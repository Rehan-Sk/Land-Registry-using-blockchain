# Land Registry using blockchain 
During my VOIS internship, I developed a blockchain-based Land Registry project aimed at enhancing transparency, security, and efficiency in property transactions. This repository contains the core implementation and documentation for the project.  

## Overview  

The Land Registry system leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable ledger of property transactions. By integrating smart contracts, the project automates verification and transfer processes, reducing fraud and streamlining administrative procedures.  

## Key Features  

- **Transparency:** Every property transaction is recorded on a public ledger, ensuring clear and accountable records.  
- **Security:** The immutable nature of blockchain prevents unauthorized alterations, mitigating fraud risks.  
- **Efficiency:** Smart contracts automate ownership verification and transfer, reducing processing time and administrative overhead.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Solidity:** Used for writing smart contracts to manage land ownership and transactions.  
- **Remix IDE:** A web-based development environment for writing, testing, and deploying Solidity smart contracts.  
- **Blockchain:** Provides a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger for property records.  

## Use Cases  

- **Land Ownership Verification:** Quickly and securely verify property ownership details.  
- **Property Transactions:** Enable seamless, automated transfers of land ownership with minimal administrative intervention.
